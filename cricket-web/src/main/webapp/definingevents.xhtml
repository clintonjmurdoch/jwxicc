			<h4 style="text-align: left">Flanagan's, Stubbies &amp; Caps -
				December 2006</h4>
			<p>When Warren Sidebottom, Chris Taylor, Simon O'Shea, Vaughan
				Garner and Colin Finn entered Flanagan's Irish Bar in the heart of
				Shepparton on a typical Saturday night for a few sneaky beers,
				little did they know of the massive venture that they were about to
				create. The fledgling team's ethos was basically known at this
				point, however it lacked a uniform and an identity. So when a
				promotion giving away a baggy red Johnnie Walker cap with the
				purchase of four Johnnie Walker stubbies, the lads didn't have to
				read each others minds to know what to do. Even Garner and O'Shea,
				dyed-in-the-wool bourbon and rum drinkers respectively, took a few
				for the team. By the end of a solid drinking session, five men had
				secured 11 delicious caps, and probably a nasty hangover for the
				following morning. The experience was so good that more troops were
				called in to do it all again and fit out more players. The Johnnie
				Walker XI was born.</p>
			<h4 style="text-align: left">Hungry Jack's Saturdays - 2006/07
				season</h4>
			<p>With close proximity to McGregor Oval and free drink refills,
				Hungry Jack's quickly became the post-match eatery of choice. But
				with a propensity to cause mischief - almost entirely the Taylor's -
				it was quickly discovered that food and frivolity are a dangerous
				mix. On several occasions, chips and pickles morphed into
				projectiles, plastic plants were tampered with and things in general
				got quite belligerent. Despite all this, even the biggest of food
				fights was only enough for some stern warnings from staff, who quite
				often carried on cleaning while the carnage unfolded. It would not
				surprise if some players' photos are still posted on the black ban
				wall.</p>
			<h4 style="text-align: left">Cas Quest - February 28, 2009</h4>
			<p>For the final match of the 2008/09 season, the boys rocked
				Ascot Vale's world when they turned up in suits, in preparation for
				Crown Casino journey that evening. And aside from for playing
				purposes, they weren't removed; Vaughan Garner conducted the coin
				toss in his baggy red and blazer, channeling the typical
				international procedure, while Jarryd Mills and Clinton Murdoch were
				well attired for umpiring. It was a full on day for Murdoch, who
				traded fielding for eight beers, bowled three drunken overs for 21
				and had random patterns shaved into his hair en route to becoming a
				skinhead. The casino only served to rile the boys up even further.
				Those who went and played blackjack were treated to an overzealous
				female Asian dealer, whose catch cry of "Too many!" prompted Warren
				Sidebottom to start singing "Too Many Times", which was repeated
				endlessly for the duration of play. To cap the night off, Andy
				Taylor had a go at craps despite not knowing the rules, and after
				tiring of the regular casino fare, decided to ask one of the floor
				staff where the 3-Man tables were.</p>
			<h4 style="text-align: left">Shenanigans at O'Malley's -
				December 2010</h4>
			<p>After an excellent triumph over Hutt River Dedication on the
				first day of Willowfest 2010, the entire squad was keen to let the
				hair down as it ventured to O'Malley's Tavern in the heart of
				Mildura. From the outset it was clear that the night was going to be
				large when several of the lads hit the Bundy Red for a free stubby
				holder, while some - especially Rhys Collier and Warren Sidebottom -
				were determined to sample anything liquid that the bar had to offer.
				Things lifted another gear when it was discovered that a lovely
				young barmaid named Zoe shared a surname with former Mildura
				resident and current player Kale Cetinich. Despite both their
				assertions that they were not related, several boys began working
				overtime on wooing her. The creative peak was reached when Vaughan
				Garner joined Collier and Sidebottom and began mixing various
				spirits, eventually stumbling on a Tullamore Dew/Midori/Coke
				combination; henceforth known as Tullamelon.</p>
			<p>
				From there the night quickly got out of hand. Garner and Simon
				O'Shea got into an argument over something that no one could
				remember and decided to throw their drinks at each other (accounts
				of who started that are also varied). While Garner went to the
				toilet to clean himself up, the bouncer was on the warpath for those
				responsible and was told by the boys that "It wasn't us", only for
				Garner to return and resume the argument right near the bouncer,
				leading to his ejection and an early bedtime. This incident was
				followed later in the week by Michael Dann and Josh O'Dwyer's brazen
				attempt to steal two barmats. Dann was caught with two mats on his
				person but was told by the bouncer he could keep one, however
				O'Dwyer's insisted on getting two. After throwing another mat over
				the beer garden fence to Dann, O'Dwyer exited with Collier and Colin
				Finn. The only problem was that Dann's tongue got the better of him,
				as he returned and exclaimed to the bouncers that "I have two of
				them!", leading to a chase of extreme proportions. Dann tried to
				escape to the Workingman's Club but was tracked down by a ute
				carrying <i>four</i> bouncers, one of whom was on the tray. What
				could have been two barmats became none, but at least they let Dann
				go. O'Dwyer, Collier and Finn were able to escape to the motel pool.

				Jimmy Maher's entire playing career in the shade</div>
			<br />
			<p>After doing everything required by defeating SPL St Columbs
				All Stars earlier in the day, the boys faced a nervous wait at the
				presentation dinner to see if they had won the Johnnies' maiden
				premiership. The table erupted as soon as Kangarilla were named in
				second place, and it wasn't long before the real fun began. It's
				always a dangerous game to hand the floor to some of the lads in our
				team, which the organisers quickly found out when Rhys Collier
				poo-pooed Jimmy Maher's entire career (video above). Patty Lahn
				tried to bring some nobility back to the team by asking a
				surprisingly good question of Maher regarding the developement of
				smaller cricketing nations, before Matt Barclay told the great man
				during a toilet break that he could slot in to next year's team "at
				number eight". Endless photos and award presentations later, the
				squad embarked on Evolution - the former O'Malley's Tavern - where
				they enjoyed a big arse ceiling fan and several hours of shuffling.</p>
